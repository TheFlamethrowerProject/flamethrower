## How it works
The 3D Printed shell houses a full 135ml can of butane which rests in the printed nozzle. The can is actuated by an N20 geared motor and the butane is ignited via a plasma arc in the path of the spray. All of the electronics are code-free and clearly layed out in [Wiring]()

This version has no metal fastners. Just 3d printed links and clever ziptie usage.

## FAQ
> Won't the plastic Melt?
Nope. The butane is ignited far away fom the plastic. The chassis will remain at air temperature and will get colder as the butane can empties. The flame is a significant distance away from the device.
